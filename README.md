# Spam Detector

This project is a Spam Detector developed during my first year as a project for my Data Science course unit.

## Description

The Spam Detector reads a dataset of spam and ham messages, cleans the data, and applies a Naive Bayes algorithm using word frequencies and probabilities. It also visualises the data using a word cloud.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of data cleaning, data visualisation, and basic machine learning techniques to classify text messages as spam or ham.
